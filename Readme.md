# Customer Family

Create customer families (professional, private individual, ...) and manage specific prices.

Also allow to define purchase prices for products.

## Compatibility
    Thelia >= 2.3.x
    
    For use with lower version of Thelia look for older tags on this module.

## Installation

### Manually

* Copy the module into ```<thelia_root>/local/modules/CustomerFamily``` directory and be sure that the name of the module is CustomerFamily.
* Activate it in your thelia administration panel

### Composer

Add it in your main thelia composer.json file

```
composer require thelia/customer-family-module:~1.5.0
```

## Usage

This module is visible in the BackOffice Customer Edit.

Use the first tab to create, edit or remove families. You can also define default family, use to show specific price to unlogged customers.

The second tab allows you to define how prices are calculated for each family, depending on the products purchase price.

Product's prices are automatically changed in the 'product' loop, you don't need to use 'customer_family_pse_calculated_prices' loop (see below) to get product's prices.
